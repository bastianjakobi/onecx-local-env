`onecx-local-env` is the local development environment for OneCX products. It is based on Docker and Docker Compose, and enables developers to quickly run local instances of the OneCX Shell, selected OneCX products and their dependencies for development and testing purposes.

`onecx-local-env` can either be used as a standalone tool, or integrated into custom development environments via Git submodules. To avoid introducing breaking changes for any existing workflows or custom environments, multiple versions of `onecx-local-env` exist in parallel.
